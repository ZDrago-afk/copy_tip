# copy_tip

copy_tip is a desktop-based educational project created for ethical hacking
and security awareness learning. It demonstrates how application-scoped
input capture can occur when users interact with untrusted or fake interfaces.

This project is intended strictly for educational and lab purposes.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Demonstrate controlled input capture techniques
- Explain risks of fake login windows and social engineering
- Help learners understand user-executed attack vectors

## 🚀 Features

- Desktop GUI built with Python (Tkinter)
- Explicit user consent before capture
- Captures keystrokes ONLY inside the application window
- Logs input locally for analysis
- No system-wide monitoring
- No background execution or persistence

## 🛠️ Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Main application script |
| `logger.py` | Logging module |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |
| `DISCLAIMER.md` | Usage disclaimer and warnings |
| `logs/` | Directory for runtime logs |


The log file (keystrokes.log) is automatically created inside the logs/
directory when the application is executed.

## ▶️ How to Run

python3 app.py

Captured logs are stored at:
logs/keystrokes.log

## 🧠 Educational Mapping (MITRE ATT&CK)

- T1204 – User Execution
- T1056.001 – Input Capture (Application-Scoped)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project captures input only within its own application window and
requires explicit user consent.

Do not use this project on systems or users without permission.

## ✅ Ethical Notice

copy_tip does not bypass operating system security controls and does not
perform any form of stealth, persistence, or unauthorized monitoring.

This project exists solely for education and ethical hacking practice.
